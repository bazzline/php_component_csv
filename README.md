# CSV Handling Component for PHP

* free as in freedom
* heavily influenced by [jwage/easy-csv](https://github.com/jwage/easy-csv)
* only created because of missing compatibility with php 5.3 and no official packagist support

# Installation @todo

# Usage

## Read

### Read Content

TODO: add other ways (readOne/readMany/readAll)

#### By Iteration

```php
$reader = new Reader('my/file.csv');

if ($reader->hasHeadline()) {
    echo 'headlines: ' . $reader->readHeadline();
}

foreach ($reader as $line) {
    echo $line . PHP_EOL;
}
```

## Write

### Write Content

#### By Iteration

```php
//$headlines contains a php array
//$lines contains a php array of arrays
$writer = new Writer('my/file.csv');

$writer->writeHeadline($headlines);

foreach ($lines as $line) {
    $writer->writeOne($line);
}
```

#### At Once

```php
//$headlines contains a php array
//$lines contains a php array of arrays
$writer = new Writer('my/file.csv');

$writer->writeHeadline($headlines);
$writer->writeMany($lines);
```

#### By Using As A Function

```php
//$line contains a php array
//$lines contains a php array of arrays
$writer = new Writer('my/file.csv');

$writer($line);

foreach ($lines as $line) {
    $writer($lines);
}
```

### Truncate

```php
$writer = new Writer('my/file.csv');

$writer->truncate();
```
